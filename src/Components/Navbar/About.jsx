            <h1>Who are Rebel Rhinos</h1>
            <p>
            Rebel Rhinos are an organisation who joined the Solana Ecosystem with Web 3.0 in mind. With this lurking on the horizon we thought it would be the ideal time to introduce our project. We are focusing on creating a strong and organic community who can help combat the main issues of society, including the poaching of Rhinos. We are a strong team of four who come from experienced development backgrounds. We plan on providing large amounts of Utility to our project, this will be disclosed overtime with further details currently being within our Road Map. Our utility will help spread awareness of the dangers Rhinos are currently experiencing, with the rapid decrease in their population, Extinction is becoming ever closer.

            Rebel Rhinos are a collection of NFT's in a realistic 3D art format. Each Rhino holds a large amount of utility, as shown in our road map, more will be disclosed over time. Holders will have the potential of receiving passive income from our giving back to the community feature (More information to be announced). Alongside this, generous donations to charity will be made throughout the project that support our vision, further information can be found within our road map including our auctions where 100% of the proceeds go to charity.

            <h1>Why mint Rebel Rhinos</h1>
            <p>
            We plan on holding large amounts of virtual and IRL events that not only our community can attend, but anyone that shares our vision. This will provide further awareness to our cause where we plan to have a community chosen charity selected where all proceeds will be donated to through these events. It will also provide a well bonded community as a result of such events. You'll be able to join us on our development journey when creating our Mobile Game. We will be listening to our community throughout all aspects of the game to provide a well adapted game suited to our community. Stay posted for further details to be announced.
